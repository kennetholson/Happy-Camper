# Happy Camper
 An Alexa skill designed to use the [ACTIVE API](http://developer.active.com/) to obtain campground information. You can ask Happy Camper for things such as a campground's description, amenities, pet policy, location and nearby attractions. You can also get a list of campgrounds near a certain location such as a city, park, or landmark. Happy Camper was built using Node.js and hosted on AWS Lambda.
